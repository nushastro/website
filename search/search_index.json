The Earth is moving around the Sun, the Sun around the Milky Way, etc. Therefore, some of the light coming from the CMB has been Doppler shifted, resulting in a higher temperature toward one side, and a lower temperature toward the other.</p> <p>If the above doesn't concern you, it should. The Earth, as a whole, is moving relative to... what? Relativity states that there is no special, universal reference frame that we can use for an absolute coordinate system, and that all frames are equally relative.</p> <p>The answer is mean: we are moving relative to the average velocity of all energy in the universe, comprising of matter, radiation, dark matter, etc. This frame is called the Cosmic Rest Frame, and does not break our Relativity, as we can measure our velocity relative to this frame. It just turns out that this frame is more important than other frames, as it encompasses the average velocity of everything in the universe.</p> <p>We can somewhat conceptualize this by imagining a globular cluster. The entire globular cluster can be seen as moving through space based on the velocity of its center of mass. If we focus a single star, chances are that it won't be moving with the same velocity as the cluster's center of mass. This relative velocity is similar to our own relative velocity relative to the average velocity of all energy, just that the cluster of mass is the entire universe.

The core is supported against gravitational collapse by quantum mechanical pressure rather than thermal pressure. This increases the density and temperature of the core until it reaches approximately 100 million kelvin, which is hot enough to cause helium fusion. However, a fundamental quality of degenerate matter is that increases in temperature do not produce an increase in volume of the matter until the thermal pressure becomes high enough to exceed degeneracy pressure (quantum mechanical pressure, which is really high). In this case, the helium fusion increases the temperature, which increases the fusion rate, which further increases the temperature in a runaway reaction. This produces a flash of very intense helium fusion that lasts only a few minutes, but briefly emits energy at a rate comparable to the entire Milky Way galaxy. In the case of normal low-mass stars, the enormous energy release causes the core to come out of degeneracy, allowing it to expand (because of the insane thermal energy), and any left-over energy is absorbed into the star's upper layers.

It is believed that at this stage, the winds are powered by lithium burning within, in a manner similar to the PP-chain.

The star\u2019s entrance into the main sequence marks the start of nuclear fusion halting the gravitational collapse of the star, producing a stable hydrostatic equilibrium. If the star collapses more, its density increases, and the radiation pressure becomes stronger, causing it to expand.
